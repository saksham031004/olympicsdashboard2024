🥇 The Olympics Games Insights Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed to analyze and explore the historical performance, trends, and athlete statistics of the Olympic Games across various eras, sports, and countries.

🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides a compelling visual analysis of key Olympic datasets, enabling users to quickly identify patterns in medal counts, athlete demographics (age/height/weight), and the geographical success of nations over time. It is built to serve sports analysts, historians, journalists, and data enthusiasts interested in the global impact and competitive dynamics of the world's premier sporting event.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – The primary platform used for data modeling, visualization design, and report creation.

📂 Power Query (M Language) – Used for data extraction, extensive cleaning, shaping, and transforming the raw Olympic dataset.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Employed for creating calculated measures, calculated columns, and complex time intelligence functions necessary for advanced performance metrics (e.g., Year-over-Year change in medal count).

📝 Data Modeling – Established relationships between athletes, results, and game event tables to ensure accurate cross-filtering and metric aggregation.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Power BI Report file (.pbix).

📊 Data Source
The project likely utilizes a rich dataset derived from publicly available Olympic archives.

Source: Official Olympic Historical Data / Public Data Repositories

Data Content: Data on thousands of athletes and events across multiple Summer and Winter Olympic Games, including records on:

Athlete Name, Age, Height, Weight

Country (NOC) and Host City

Sport, Event, and Medal Type (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

Year and Season (Summer/Winter)

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into Olympic history.

Business Problem: Analyzing complex, large-scale historical sports data to identify long-term trends and comparative performance is difficult using static reports or raw data.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, drill-down interface for exploring Olympic history, simplifying comparisons between countries and pinpointing key performance indicators.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Highlighting total Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total Medals won globally or by selection.

Historical Performance Chart: A trendline showing a Country's Medal Count Over Time (e.g., filtered by the user).

Medal Distribution Map: A choropleth map showing Medal Counts by Country, enabling quick geographical analysis of success.

Sport-Specific Analysis: Bar charts and tables ranking the Top Athletes or Countries within selected sports (e.g., Athletics, Swimming).

Demographic Insights: Scatter plots or box plots showing the correlation between Athlete Age, Height, or Weight and Medal Success across different disciplines.
